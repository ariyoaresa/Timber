        <p>Inspired by the Greek Goddess THEIA, this evening wear, bridal and day dress collection was created to bring out every woman’s inner goddess. One of the original Titans, THEIA who ruled during the Greek Golden Age, possessed the incredible power of light which radiated from her sparkling eyes. All that she gazed upon glittered, becoming luminous and radiant.  She imbued gold and silver with their shine. She gave diamonds their fire and rubies and emeralds their sparkle.  Her three children; Helios the sun, Celene the moon, and Eos the dawn, all continue to bring light in to the world everyday.</p>

        <p>The THEIA collection combines sophisticated and elegant styling with luxurious silks, European brocades, laces, and prints. THEIA’s exquisite beading and embroideries are created by some of the finest couture studios in the world. Each piece is meticulously stitched together to create exquisite gowns and cocktail dresses that flow beautifully around the body.  The woman who wears THEIA will be filled with confidence knowing her dress fits wonderfully and looks beautiful on her, thus naturally allowing her inner goddess to shine. </p>
        <p>THEIA launched in stores in Fall 2009 and is currently sold in over 350 stores globally including Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and fine specialty stores.</p>

        <h2>Don O’Neill</h2>
        <h3>Creative Director</h3>
        <p>Don O’Neill, known for his elegant and sophisticated evening wear, was born in a small village in the west of Ireland.  From an early age, his mother and her clothing inspired him with her elegant Bergdorf Goodman dresses and Ib Jorgensen couture suits.  Throughout Don’s formative years, this inspiration fueled his dreams of becoming a fashion designer.</p>

      <div class="carousel">
        <div class="slide">

          <p>Initially training as a chef, O’Neill was able to follow his true passion and study to be a fashion designer after winning a full tuition scholarship to the Barbara Bourke College of Fashion Design.  Upon graduating, Don moved to London and apprenticed with Gina Fratini, Royal Couturier and fabled ball gown designer.  He then went on to work with Couturier Donald Campbell in Knightsbridge.</p>
          <p>Following his apprenticeships in London, Don moved to Paris to continue his training, most notably alongside Christian Lacroix in the couture studio.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="slide">

          <p>After spending time in Paris, Don won a Green Card and based on the advice of Lacroix’s astrologist, decided to move to New York.  Recognizing his immense talents, Don was hired by Carmen Marc Valvo, where he became the Design Director.  After ten years with Carmen Marc Valvo, Don was lured away and went on to launch a new bridge eveningwear collection for Badgley Mischka, The Badgley Mischka Platinum label, which under his stewardship grew to be enormously successful.</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="slide">

          <p>Today, Don serves as the Creative Director for THEIA.  The collection is a manifestation of Don’s vision to bring out every woman’s inner goddess.  The collection opened in the Fall of 2009 to rave reviews, immediately being bought by Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, and specialty stores around the globe.  The designs have also garnered praise by celebrities including Taylor Swift, Carrie Underwood, Oprah Winfrey, Emmy Rossum, and Norah Jones as well as media outlets including <em>The New York Times, The Wall St. Journal, Style.com, Vogue.com, InStyle, People Magazine, Martha Stewart Weddings, Life & Style, New York Magazine, E! News and more.</em></p>

        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.</p>
        <p>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.</p>

        <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>
        <p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages.</p>
